# Professional Portfolio

Homework 2

## Description

This project is a personal portfolio template for me to add my future projects. It will have cards where I can add links to direct the user to my projects within my class. It also has links to all my social media platforms and my resume.

## Installation

To install this code you must search https://github.com/rossgilman402/Professional-Portfolio. Next, you must type in your terminal in a directory of your choice git clone https://github.com/rossgilman402/Professional-Portfolio.git. You will now have the code and the github where all of the code is stored. You may access the webpage on https://github.com/rossgilman402/Professional-Portfolio.git.

## Usage

This is used as an extension to my resume. It will display all of the future project that I will construct in class so that recruiters and fellow computer scientists can view my skills.

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager’s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
